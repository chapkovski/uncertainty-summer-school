            You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. One of you will be selected at
            random to
            be participant A; the other will be participant B. You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior
            to
            making any decision.</p>
        <p>
            To start, both of you receive {{ Constants.endowment }}.
            Participant A can send some or all
            of his {{ Constants.endowment }} to participant B.
            Before B receives this amount, it will be multiplied by {{ Constants.coef }}. Once B receives
            this multiplied amount he can decide to send some or all of it to A.
